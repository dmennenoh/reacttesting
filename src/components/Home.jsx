                Welcome to my little portfolio site. Thanks for looking. I've been building web sites, games, photobooths, and other interactives for the past 20 years or so. 
                Here you'll find a little sampling of the many projects I've worked on and some of the tools I've used to create them.<br/><br/>
                This site is made with React, React Router and React Bootstrap, and is a work in progress.
