Wands were outfitted with an IR LED in the tip, and OpenCV's blob detector was used to segment the IR spot from the rest of the video. Particle effects were then added to make it look like a spell was being cast when the wand was moved around. Two web cams were used to do this - one for regular video recording, and one that was modifed to only see IR.
